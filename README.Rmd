**Citavi** ([Official Website](https://www.citavi.com/de), [Official GitHub](https://github.com/Citavi)) is a software program for reference management and knowledge organization. When working with [local Citavi projects](https://www1.citavi.com/sub/manual6/en/index.html?101_creating_a_local_project.html) (as opposed to [cloud](https://www1.citavi.com/sub/manual6/en/index.html?101_creating_a_cloud_project.html) or [server](https://www1.citavi.com/sub/manual6/en/index.html?101_creating_a_server_project.html) projects) you can directly work on the (database stored in) the `.ctv6` file via SQL. `CitaviR` provides functionality for 

  1. reading the data from the `.ctv6` file
  2. dealing with the data while it is *outside* Citavi to get the most out of it
  3. writing/updating the data into the `.ctv6` file
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}

```
