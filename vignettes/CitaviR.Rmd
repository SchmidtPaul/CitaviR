In general, the work flow from start to finish is structured in five steps.

Step | CitaviR | Effort: 1st time setup | Effort: regular use
-|-|-|-
Step 1: Citavi to xlsx    |         | &#128527; | &#128526;
Step 2: xlsx to R         | &#9989; | &#128526; | &#128526;
Step 3: Process data in R | &#9989; | &#128527; | &#128526;
Step 4: R to xlsx         | &#9989; | &#128526; | &#128526;
Step 5: xlsx to Citavi    |         | &#128165; | &#128527;

**Effort levels:** low effort &#128526;; acceptable effort &#128527;; can be cumbersome &#128165; 

# Step 1: Citavi to xlsx

In your Citavi project open the table view.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviR/blob/master/vignettes/Citavi_Table.png?raw=true")
```

Make sure all relevant columns are selected (e.g. via Citavi's [customizable selection presets](https://www1.citavi.com/sub/manual6/en/index.html?referencegridformworkspaceeditor.html)) and export to an Excel file.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviR/blob/master/vignettes/Citavi_TableToExcel.png?raw=true")
```

# Step 2: xlsx to R

The Excel file exported above is available in `CitaviR` as the example dataset `3dupsin5refs.xlsx`. Furthermore, `read_Citavi_xlsx()` offers an import function based on `readxl::read_excel()` with some functionality specifically for xls/xlsx files created with Citavi via export to Excel.

```{r example, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(CitaviR)

my_path <- example_xlsx("3dupsin5refs.xlsx") # in real life: replace with path to your xlsx file
CitDat  <- read_Citavi_xlsx(path = my_path)

CitDat
```

# Step 3: Process data in R

At this point there are many things one may wish to do with the data. In this example we will make use of the `CitaviR` functions to identify and handle *obvious duplicates*.

## Find obvious duplicates

```{r}
CitDat <- CitDat %>% 
  find_obvious_dups()
```

One way of identifying *obvious duplicates* is via `CitaviR::find_obvious_dups()`. In short, it first creates a `clean_title` by combining each reference's `Title` and `Year` into a simplified string. This simplification is based on `janitor::make_clean_names()` and *e.g.* converts to all-lowercase, and removes special characters and unnecessary spaces. If two references have the same `clean_title`, they are identified as *obvious duplicates*. In this example, two references were indeed identified as *obvious duplicates*:
 
```{r}
CitDat %>%
 select(Title, clean_title:obv_dup_id)
```
 
Note how a single typo ("Hritability") prevents `ct_03` from being detected as an *obvious duplicate* for `ct_02`. For cases like this, one may use `CitaviR::find_potential_dups()`, but we will not go so far in this introduction.

## Handle obvious duplicates
 
At this point we have already gained information and could continue with steps 4 and 5. However, sometimes duplicates hold different information as it is the case here for `ct_02` and the columns `PubMed ID`, `DOI name` and `Categories`:

```{r}
CitDat %>% 
  filter(clean_title_id == "ct_02") %>% 
  select(clean_title_id, obv_dup_id, `DOI name`, `PubMed ID`, Categories)
```

In such a scenario it would be best to gather all information into the one *non-duplicate* (=`dup_01`) that will be kept and of interest later on. Here, `CitaviR::handle_obvious_dups()` comes in handy:

```{r}
CitDat <- CitDat %>% 
  handle_obvious_dups(fieldsToHandle = c("DOI name", "PubMed ID"), 
                      nameDupCategories = "3 duplicate")
```

As can be seen, the columns listed in `fieldsToHandle =` are *filled up* (*i.e.* `tidyr::fill(all_of(fieldsToHandle), .direction = "up")`). By providing a string for `nameDupCategories =`, unique entries in the `Categories` column are collapsed into the respective entry for `dup_01`, while entries for all other obvious duplicates are replaced by the provided string. 

```{r}
CitDat %>% 
  filter(clean_title_id == "ct_02") %>% 
  select(clean_title_id, obv_dup_id, `DOI name`, `PubMed ID`, Categories)
```

Therefore, we could now get rid of all obvious duplicates (`obv_dup_id =! dup_01`) without losing any information.

# Step 4: R to xlsx

To export this table to Excel, `write_Citavi_xlsx()` offers an export function based on `openxlsx::write.xlsx()` with some extra functionality. For example, when supplying the same path we used for `read_Citavi_xlsx(path = ...)` in [Step 2](#step-2-xlsx-to-r), the xlsx file will be created in the same folder it was imported from with a slightly altered name:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write_Citavi_xlsx(CitDat, read_path = my_path) # works in real life, but not for example data
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviR/blob/master/vignettes/Excel_files_out.png?raw=true")
```

# Step 5: xlsx to Citavi

We now make use of the custom Citavi macros to import the information from excel to Citavi.
In this case, we can make use of [CIMR 002](https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviRMacros/tree/main/CIMR%20Import/CIMR%20002%20-%20Import%20handle_obvious_dup%20info), which is one of the macro templates provided in the repository [CitaviRMacros](https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviRMacros). As can be seen in [**this gif** &#9199;](https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviRMacros/tree/main/CIMR%20Import/CIMR%20002%20-%20Import%20handle_obvious_dup%20info#cimr-002-import-handle_obvious_dups){:target="_blank"}, we here store the `obv_dup_id`s into *Custom field 1*, while it is made sure to import the *PubMed ID* information handled in [step 3](#handle-obvious-duplicates). In order to also import the handled categories, one would additionaly use [CIMR 010](https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviRMacros/tree/main/CIMR%20Import/CIMR%20010%20-%20Import%20categories) **[TO DO]**.

Afterwards, we could delete all titles in the Citavi project that are not `dup_01` and get rid of all obvious duplicates without losing information.

In order to make this work and reproduce *e.g.* what can be seen in [the gif mentioned in step 5](https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviRMacros/tree/main/CIMR%20Import/CIMR%20002%20-%20Import%20handle_obvious_dup%20info#cimr-002-import-handle_obvious_dups) you must first

> Note that it is this very macro **CIM007** that makes all of this possible. Without it, `CitaviR` would not nearly be as useful since - according to my knowledge - there is currently no other way to import Excel data into Citavi. All Import-macros ("CIMR" prefix) in the repository [CitaviRMacros](https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviRMacros) are basically adpated versions of CIM007.
