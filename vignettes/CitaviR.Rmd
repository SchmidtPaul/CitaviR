knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",

)
set.seed(42)
```

In general, the work flow from start to finish is structured in three steps.

  1. reading the data from the `.ctv6` file
  2. dealing with the data while it is *outside* Citavi to get the most out of it
  3. writing/updating the data into the `.ctv6` file
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviR/blob/master/man/figures/WorkflowSQL.png?raw=true")
```

# Step 1: Citavi to R

The following screenshot shows the Citavi project that is available in `CitaviR` as the `3dupsin5refs.ctv6`. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviR/blob/master/vignettes/Citavi_Project.PNG?raw=true")
```

Here, we can read in the information of interest via `read_Citavi_ctv6()`.

```{r example, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(CitaviR)

example_path <- example_file("3dupsin5refs/3dupsin5refs.ctv6") # in real life: replace with your path
CitDat <- read_Citavi_ctv6(path = example_path,
                           CitDBTableName = "Reference")

CitDat %>% select(Title, Year, Abstract, DOI) 
```

> If, for whatever reason, you wish to do the import from Citavi not via SQL, but with Excel files (exported from Citavi), then `CitaviR` offers an alternative approach via `read_Citavi_xlsx()` and `write_Citavi_xlsx()` described [here](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/CitaviR/articles/excel_instead_of_sql.html).

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# quietly store the Citavi project for later
OriginalCitDat <- CitDat
```

# Step 2: Process data in R

At this point there are many things one may wish to do with the data. In this example we will make use of the `CitaviR` functions to identify and handle *obvious duplicates*. (Check out the [article on obvious and potential duplicates](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/CitaviR/articles/obv_pot_dups.html) for more.)

## Find obvious duplicates

```{r}
CitDat <- CitDat %>% 
  find_obvious_dups()
```

One way of identifying *obvious duplicates* is via `CitaviR::find_obvious_dups()`. In short, it first creates a `clean_title` by combining each reference's `Title` and `Year` into a simplified string. This simplification is based on `janitor::make_clean_names()` and *e.g.* converts to all-lowercase, and removes special characters and unnecessary spaces. If two references have the same `clean_title`, they are identified as *obvious duplicates*. In this example, two references were indeed identified as *obvious duplicates*:
 
```{r}
CitDat %>%
 select(Title, clean_title:obv_dup_id)
```
 
Note how a single typo ("Hritability") prevents `ct_03` from being detected as an *obvious duplicate* for `ct_02`. For cases like this, one may use `CitaviR::find_potential_dups()`, which is explained in the [article on obvious and potential duplicates](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/CitaviR/articles/obv_pot_dups.html) but not done here.

## Handle obvious duplicates
 
At this point we have already gained information and could continue with steps 4 and 5. However, sometimes duplicates hold different information as it is the case here for `ct_02` and the columns `PubMedID` and `DOI`:

```{r}
CitDat %>% 
  filter(clean_title_id == "ct_02") %>% 
  select(clean_title_id, obv_dup_id, DOI, PubMedID)
```

In such a scenario it would be best to gather all information into the one *non-duplicate* (=`dup_01`) that will be kept and of interest later on. Here, `CitaviR::handle_obvious_dups()` comes in handy:

```{r}
CitDat <- CitDat %>% 
  handle_obvious_dups(fieldsToHandle = c("DOI", "PubMedID"))
```

As can be seen, the columns listed in `fieldsToHandle =` are *filled up* (*i.e.* `tidyr::fill(all_of(fieldsToHandle), .direction = "up")`). 

```{r}
CitDat %>% 
  filter(clean_title_id == "ct_02") %>% 
  select(clean_title_id, obv_dup_id, DOI, PubMedID)
```

Therefore, we could now get rid of all obvious duplicates (`obv_dup_id =! dup_01`) without losing any information.

# Step 3: R to Citavi

Finally, we want to implement the gained information into the Citavi project. To do so, we can make use of `update_Citavi_ctv6()`. Say we would like to overwrite the old DOI and PubMed information and additionally store the `clean_title_id` and `obv_dup_id` in *Custom field 1* and *Custom field 2*, respectively. You should probably close your Citavi project before running this:

```{r}
CitDat %>%
  update_Citavi_ctv6(
    path = example_path,
    CitDBTableName = "Reference",
    CitDatVarToCitDBTableVar = c(
        "DOI"            = "DOI",
        "PubMedID"       = "PubMedID",
        "clean_title_id" = "CustomField1",
        "obv_dup_id"     = "CustomField2"),
    quiet = FALSE
  )
```

If you now open the Citavi project, it should have changed as expected.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/SchmidtPaul/CitaviR/blob/master/man/figures/Citavi_BeforeAfter.png?raw=true")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# quietly restore the Citavi project to original state
OriginalCitDat %>%
  mutate(clean_title_id = NA_character_,
         obv_dup_id = NA_character_) %>% 
  update_Citavi_ctv6(
    path = example_path,
    CitDBTableName = "Reference",
    CitDatVarToCitDBTableVar = c(
        "DOI"            = "DOI",
        "PubMedID"       = "PubMedID",
        "clean_title_id" = "CustomField1",
        "obv_dup_id"     = "CustomField2"),
    quiet = TRUE
  )
```
